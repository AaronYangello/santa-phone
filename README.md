**AI Santa Phone**
================

A festive and interactive phone system that allows children to talk to Santa Claus using a physical phone interface.

**Overview**
------------

The AI Santa Phone is a microservices-based system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition to generate responses to user input. The system consists of several services, including:

* **Conversational AI Service**: generates responses to user input using a conversational AI model
* **Speech Recognition Service**: recognizes user speech and converts it into text
* **Text-to-Speech Service**: converts text into audio
* **Phone Interface Service**: interacts with the physical phone interface and sends/receives audio signals
* **Audio Processing Service**: processes audio signals and applies effects

**Features**
------------

* **Physical Phone Interface**: a 3D-printed phone that allows children to interact with the system
* **Conversational AI**: generates responses to user input using a conversational AI model
* **Speech Recognition**: recognizes user speech and converts it into text
* **Text-to-Speech**: converts text into audio
* **Festive Sound Effects**: plays festive sound effects and music to enhance the user experience

**Requirements**
------------

* **Python 3.x**: required for running the services
* **Docker**: required for containerization and orchestration
* **Kubernetes**: required for orchestration and deployment
* **3D Printer**: required for printing the physical phone interface
* **Audio Hardware**: required for interacting with the physical phone interface

**Usage**
-----

1. Pick up the phone and say "Hello, Santa!"
2. The system will recognize your speech and generate a response using the conversational AI model
3. The system will play the response as audio using the text-to-speech service
4. You can continue to converse with Santa by speaking into the phone
