# Santa Phone Microservice Architecture

1. **Conversational AI Service**: Responsible for generating responses to user input. This service will use a conversational AI model to analyze the user's input and generate a response.
2. **Speech Recognition Service**: Responsible for recognizing the user's speech and converting it into text. This service will use a speech recognition algorithm to analyze the user's audio input and generate a text representation of their speech.
3. **Text-to-Speech Service**: Responsible for converting the conversational AI service's response into audio. This service will use a text-to-speech algorithm to generate an audio representation of the conversational AI service's response.
4. **Phone Interface Service**: Responsible for interacting with the physical phone and sending/receiving audio signals. This service will use a library or framework to interact with the physical phone's audio hardware.
5. **Audio Processing Service**: Responsible for processing the audio signals sent/received by the phone interface service. This service will use a library or framework to process the audio signals, such as adjusting the volume or applying audio effects.
